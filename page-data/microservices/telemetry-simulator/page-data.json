The [Appsody CLI](https://appsody.dev/docs/installing/installing-appsody) is a required prerequisite for building the application locally.\n\nAppsody will build the application by pulling the contents of the Appsody Stack it is based on and then performing the local application build inside the containerized environment:\n\n`appsody build -t <yournamespace>/kcontainer-reefer-simulator-appsody[:tag] [--push]`\n\n- You can optionally specify a container tag. If left blank, `latest` will be used.\n- You can optionally supply the `--push` flag to automatically push the built image to specified remote repository.\n\nPerforming an Appsody build will update the `app-deploy.yaml` file in the same directory with current information for the application image, labels, and annotations fields.\n\n## Run\n\n### Deployment parameters\n\nThe following deployment parameters are defined in the `app-deploy.yaml` file:\n\n| Name                                     | Required | Description                                                                                                            |\n|------------------------------------------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| KAFKA_BROKERS                            | YES      | Comma-separated list of Kafka brokers to connect to                                                                    |\n| KAFKA_APIKEY                             | NO       | API Key used to connect to SASL-secured Kafka brokers.

As noted in the `KAFKA_CERT` parameter above, these files are SSL-based certificates which are required to verfiy the identity of the external service when calling it. These files are provided as `--docker-options \"-v host-src:container-dest ...\"` when running the microservice locally and as a Volume Mount when running the microservice on a Kubernetes cluster.\n\nThe `KAFKA_CERT` parameter is documented in the **Event Streams Certificates** section of the [Prerequisites](/infrastructure/required-services/#ibm-event-streams-on-redhat-openshift-container-platform) page. The Appsody run command should include a parameter similar to `-v /Users/myuser/Downloads/es-cert.pem:/certs/es-cert.pem` in its `--docker-options` string to run this microservice locally.\n\n**Example:** `appsody run --docker-options \"-v /Users/myuser/Downloads/es-cert.pem:/certs/es-cert.pem\" ...`\n\n### Running the microservice locally\n\nWhen running the microservice locally, you must specify all the required [deployment parameters](#deployment-parameters) from above as environment variables via the `--docker-options` flag being passed in from the Appsody CLI command.\n\n**Example:** `appsody run --docker-options \"-e KAFKA_BROKERS=remotebroker1:9092,remotebroker2:9092 -e CONTAINER_TOPIC=containers -v /Users/myuser/Downloads/es-cert.pem:/certs/es-cert.pem\" ...`\n\nFor more details on running the microservice locally, consult the [Appsody run documentation](https://appsody.dev/docs/using-appsody/local-development#appsody-local-development) as well as the deployment information contained in the [`app-deploy.yaml`](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-reefer-ml/blob/master/simulator/app-deploy.yaml) file.\n\n### Running the microservice remotely\n\nThe [Appsody Operator](https://appsody.dev/docs/reference/appsody-operator/) is a required prerequisite for deploying the microservice to a remote Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster.\n\nTo deploy the microservice to a remote cluster:\n\n`appsody deploy <yournamespace>/kcontainer-reefer-simulator-appsody[:tag] --no-build`\n\n- You can omit the `--no-build` flag to have Appsody perform a build before deploying the application.\n- _**Note:**_ Performing a build at deploy time requires specifying the absolute container reference path, as well as the `--push` flag.\n- The neccesary deployment parameter information will be read from the `app-deploy.yaml` file in the same directory.\n\n## Usage Details\n\n### REST APIs\n\n<InlineNotification kind=\"info\"><strong>TODO</strong> REST APIs documentation via Swagger</InlineNotification>\n\n**Reference:** https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-reefer-ml/blob/master/simulator/api/controlapi.yml\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"06054b5ee1a2c9785b64be85c87ab9d6","counter":367,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Telemetry Simulator","description":"The telemetry simulator component is a Python-based application for generating anomalous data events for refrigerated shipping containers (also known as 'reefers')."},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Telemetry Simulator\ndescription: The telemetry simulator component is a Python-based application for generating anomalous data events for refrigerated shipping containers (also known as 'reefers').\n---\n\n<PageDescription>\nThe telemetry simulator component is a Python-based application for generating anomalous data events for refrigerated shipping containers (also known as 'reefers').\n</PageDescription>\n\n<AnchorLinks>\n  <AnchorLink>Overview</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Build</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Run</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Usage Details</AnchorLink>\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n## Overview\n\n**Description:** The Simulator webapp is a simple python (3.7) flask web app exposing a REST POST end point to control the type of simulation to run and to produce Reefer telemetry events to kafka reeferTelemetry topic.\n\nThis microservice has been implemented using the [Appsody Python Flask stack](https://github.com/appsody/stacks/tree/master/incubator/python-flask).\n\n![Simulator diagram](images/microservice-overview-telemetry-simulator.png)\n\n**Github repository:** [refarch-reefer-ml](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-reefer-ml)\n\n**Folder:** [simulator](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-reefer-ml/tree/master/simulator)\n\n**Kafka topics consumed from:** None\n\n**Kafka topics produced to:**\n\n- [Reefer Telemetry Topic](/microservices/topic-details/#reefer-telemetry-topic)\n\n**Events reacted to:** None\n\n**Events produced:**\n\n- [Container Telemetry Event](/microservices/event-details/#container-telemetry-event)\n\n**EDA Patterns implemented:** None\n\n## Build\n\nThis microservice is built using the [Appsody](https://appsody.dev/) development framework.
