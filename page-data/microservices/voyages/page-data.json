A voyage consist of carrying a limited amount of goods from a source port to a destination port being the goods carried by a uniquely identified ship on a specific date. All those attributes make a voyage unique and these voyages are managed by this microservice. Voyages microservice will then be responsible to allocate a voyage to an order based on where this order needs to be carried from and to, the window time the goods need to be carried within and the amount of goods to be carried. Written in NodeJS, this microservice assigns a voyage to an order (and manage the remaining capacity on the ship making such voyage) if any suitable voyage is found and emit the consequent VoyageAssigned Event or will otherwise emit a VoyageNotFound Event.\n\n![Voyages diagram](images/microservice-overview-voyages.png)\n\n**Github repository:** [refarch-kc-ms](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-kc-ms)\n\n**Folder:** [voyage-ms](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-kc-ms/tree/master/voyage-ms)\n\n**Kafka topics consumed from:**\n\n- [Order Topic](/microservices/topic-details/#orders-topic)\n\n**Kafka topics produced to:**\n\n- [Order Topic](/microservices/topic-details/#orders-topic)\n\n**Events reacted to:**\n\n- [Order Created Event](/microservices/event-details/#order-created-event)\n- [Order Reject Event](/microservices/event-details/#order-reject-event)\n- [Order Cancel Event](/microservices/event-details/#order-cancel-event)\n- [Container Allocated Event](/microservices/event-details/#container-allocated-event)\n- [Container Not Found Event](/microservices/event-details/#container-not-found-event)\n\n**Events produced:**\n\n- [Voyage Assigned Event](/microservices/event-details/#voyage-assigned-event)\n- [Voyage Not Found Event](/microservices/event-details/#voyage-not-found-event)\n\n**EDA Patterns implemented:**\n\n- [Saga Patterns](/implementation/saga-patterns/)\n\n## Build\n\nThis microservice is built using the [Appsody](https://appsody.dev/) development framework. The [Appsody CLI](https://appsody.dev/docs/installing/installing-appsody) is a required prerequisite for building the application locally.\n\nAppsody will build the application by pulling the contents of the Appsody Stack it is based on and then performing the local application build inside the containerized environment:\n\n`appsody build -t <yournamespace>/kcontainer-voyages-ms[:tag] [--push]`\n\n- You can optionally specify a container tag. If left blank, `latest` will be used.\n- You can optionally supply the `--push` flag to automatically push the built image to specified remote repository.\n\nPerforming an Appsody build will update the `app-deploy.yaml` file in the same directory with current information for the application image, labels, and annotations fields.\n\n## Run\n\n### Deployment parameters\n\nThe following deployment parameters are defined in the `app-deploy.yaml` file:\n\n| Name                                     | Required | Description                                                                                                            |\n|------------------------------------------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| KAFKA_BROKERS                            | YES      | Comma-separated list of Kafka brokers to connect to                                                                    |\n| KAFKA_APIKEY                             | NO       | API Key used to connect to SASL-secured Kafka brokers.

As noted in the `CERTS_PATH` parameter above, these files are SSL-based certificates which are required to verfiy the identity of the external service when calling it. These files are provided as `--docker-options \"-v host-src:container-dest ...\"` when running the microservice locally and as a Volume Mount when running the microservice on a Kubernetes cluster.\n\nThe `CERTS_PATH` parameter is documented in the **Event Streams Certificates** section of the [Prerequisites](/infrastructure/required-services/#ibm-event-streams-on-redhat-openshift-container-platform) page. The Appsody run command should include a parameter similar to `-v /Users/myuser/Downloads/es-cert.pem:/etc/ssl/certs/kcontainer/es-cert.pem` in its `--docker-options` string to run this microservice locally.\n\n**Example:** `appsody run --docker-options \"-v /Users/myuser/Downloads/es-cert.pem:/etc/ssl/certs/kcontainer/es-cert.pem \" ...`\n\n### Running the microservice locally\n\nWhen running the microservice locally, you must specify all the required [deployment parameters](#deployment-parameters) from above as environment variables via the `--docker-options` flag being passed in from the Appsody CLI command.\n\n**Example:** `appsody run --docker-options \"-e KAFKA_BROKERS=remotebroker1:9092,remotebroker2:9092 -e ORDER_TOPIC=orders -v /Users/myuser/Downloads/es-cert.pem:/etc/ssl/certs/kcontainer/es-cert.jks\" ...`\n\nFor more details on running the microservice locally, consult the [Appsody run documentation](https://appsody.dev/docs/using-appsody/local-development#appsody-local-development) as well as the deployment information contained in the [`app-deploy.yaml`](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-kc-ms/blob/master/voyages-ms/app-deploy.yaml) file.\n\n### Running the microservice remotely\n\nThe [Appsody Operator](https://appsody.dev/docs/reference/appsody-operator/) is a required prerequisite for deploying the microservice to a remote Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster.\n\nTo deploy the microservice to a remote cluster:\n\n`appsody deploy <yournamespace>/kcontainer-voyages-ms[:tag] --no-build`\n\n- You can omit the `--no-build` flag to have Appsody perform a build before deploying the application.\n- _**Note:**_ Performing a build at deploy time requires specifying the absolute container reference path, as well as the `--push` flag.\n- The neccesary deployment parameter information will be read from the `app-deploy.yaml` file in the same directory.\n\n## Usage Details\n\n### REST APIs\n\n<InlineNotification kind=\"info\"><strong>TODO</strong> REST APIs documentation via Swagger</InlineNotification>\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"242f594ed675737bd23e4d3a17dff93d","counter":407,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Voyage Management","description":"In-depth description of the Voyages Management microservice component of the Reefer Container Shipment solution reference implementation."},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Voyage Management\ndescription: In-depth description of the Voyages Management microservice component of the Reefer Container Shipment solution reference implementation.\n---\n\n<PageDescription>\nThis service keeps track of each scheduled, current or completed voyage of container carreer vessels, being loaded with containers at a source port, sailing to a destination port and having onboard containers unloaded there.\n</PageDescription>\n\n<AnchorLinks>\n  <AnchorLink>Overview</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Build</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Run</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Usage Details</AnchorLink>\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n## Overview\n\n**Description:** This microservice manages the voyages for each ship.
