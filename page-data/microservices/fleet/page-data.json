The service exposes simple REST API to support getting ships and fleets information, and start and stop simulator to emulate ship movements and container metrics events generation. When a ship leaves or enters it will also generate the events as listed in the analysis.\n\n**Github repository:** [refarch-kc-ms](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-kc-ms)\n\n**Folder:** [fleet-ms](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-kc-ms/tree/master/fleet-ms)\n\n**Kafka topics consumed from:** TBD\n\n**Kafka topics produced to:** TBD\n\n**Events reacted to:** TBD\n\n**Events produced:** TBD\n\n**EDA Patterns implemented:** TBD\n\n## Build\n\nTBD Appsody\n\n## Run\n\nTBD Appsody\n\n## Integration Tests\n\nTBD Source from https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/refarch-kc-ms/fleetms/#running-integration-tests-with-kafka\n\n## Implementation Details\n\nTBD Source from https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/refarch-kc-ms/fleetms/\n\n### What you will learn\n\n* Using JAXRS API to define REST resources\n* Using microprofile for API documentation\n* How to leverage WebSphere Liberty in container to support simple JEE and microprofile services\n* Kafka producer code example\n* Test Driven Development with JAXRS and Integration test with Kafka\n\nWe recommend also reading the [producer design and coding considerations article](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-eda/blob/master/docs/kafka/producers.md)\n\n### Pre-Requisites\n\n* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) used to compile and package the application.\n* Java 8: Any compliant JVM should work.\n  * [Java 8 JDK from Oracle](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)\n  * [Java 8 JDK from IBM (AIX, Linux, z/OS, IBM i)](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/),\n    or [Download a Liberty server package](https://developer.ibm.com/assets/wasdev/#filter/assetTypeFilters=PRODUCT)\n    that contains the IBM JDK (Windows, Linux)\n* We used [Eclipse 2018 edition](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) IDE for Java development.\n* Clone the parent project to get access to docker compose yml files: `git clone https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-kc`.

Each ship has a unique shipID. We limit the scope of a minimum viable product so the following user stories are implemented:\n\n* [x] The information about each ship is kept in a json file for a fleet. Ships are uniquely identified by their name (as shipID).\n* [x] The capacity of a ship is represented by a matrix, number of rows x number of columns to make it simpler. Therefore the total number of container is rows*columns.\n* [x] Support GPS lat/log position reports, as ship position event, of the position of the ship a different point in time. This is modeled as csv file with one row of (lat,log) pair, a row representing a time stamp. (1h?)\n* [ ] Generate ship event when leaving source port and when entering destination port, and when docked.\n* [ ] Define query of what happen to a ship from a given time to retrace its past voyages.\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"ecb6070b85cbbfd84527dcc3f03402da","counter":334,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Shipping Fleet Management","description":"TBD Deployment of application microservices"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Shipping Fleet Management\ndescription: TBD Deployment of application microservices\n---\n\n<InlineNotification kind=\"warning\">UNDER CONSTRUCTION</InlineNotification>\n\n<PageDescription>\nThis microservice is responsible to support simulation of fleet of container carrier vessels.
