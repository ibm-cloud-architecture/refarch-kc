Defaults to `8080`.                                    |\n\n### Volume Mounts\n\nThe User Interface microservice requires up to one file to be injected at runtime for proper operation. As noted in the `TRUSTSTORE_PATH` parameter above, these files are SSL-based certificates which are required to verfiy the identity of the external service when calling it. These files are provided as `--docker-options \"-v host-src:container-dest ...\"` when running the microservice locally and as a Volume Mount when running the microservice on a Kubernetes cluster.\n\nThe `TRUSTSTORE_PATH` parameter is documented in the **Event Streams Certificates** section of the [Prerequisites](/infrastructure/required-services/#ibm-event-streams-on-redhat-openshift-container-platform) page. The Appsody run command should include a parameter similar to `-v /Users/myuser/Downloads/es-cert.jks:/config/resources/security/es-ssl/es-cert.jks` in its `--docker-options` string to run this microservice locally.\n\n**Example:** `appsody run --docker-options \"-v /Users/myuser/Downloads/es-cert.jks:/config/resources/security/es-ssl/es-cert.jks \" ...`\n\n### Running the microservice locally\n\nWhen running the microservice locally, you must specify all the required [deployment parameters](#deployment-parameters) from above as environment variables via the `--docker-options` flag being passed in from the Appsody CLI command.\n\n**Example:** `appsody run --docker-options \"-e KAFKA_BROKERS=remotebroker1:9092,remotebroker2:9092 -e PROBLEM_TOPIC=bluewater-problem -e SHIP_TOPIC=bluewater-ships -v /Users/myuser/Downloads/es-cert.jks:/config/resources/security/es-ssl/es-cert.jks\" ...`\n\nFor more details on running the microservice locally, consult the [Appsody run documentation](https://appsody.dev/docs/using-appsody/local-development#appsody-local-development) as well as the deployment information contained in the [`app-deploy.yaml`](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-kc-ui/blob/master/app-deploy.yaml) file.\n\n### Running the microservice remotely\n\nThe [Appsody Operator](https://appsody.dev/docs/reference/appsody-operator/) is a required prerequisite for deploying the microservice to a remote Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster.\n\nTo deploy the microservice to a remote cluster:\n\n`appsody deploy <yournamespace>/kcontainer-ui[:tag] --no-build`\n\n- You can omit the `--no-build` flag to have Appsody perform a build before deploying the application.\n- _**Note:**_ Performing a build at deploy time requires specifying the absolute container reference path, as well as the `--push` flag.\n- The neccesary deployment parameter information will be read from the `app-deploy.yaml` file in the same directory.\n\n## Usage Details\n\n### REST APIs\n\n<InlineNotification kind=\"info\"><strong>TODO</strong> REST APIs documentation via Swagger</InlineNotification>\n\n<!--\n### User stories\n\nThis project is in light development so the following user stories are in plan (or done):\n\n- As a fleet manager I want to login to the webapp to access the fleet management feature. Use eddie@email.com.\n- As a fleet manager I want to select one of the fleet to get the list of ships with their attributes in a table format, and plot the ship on a map at their respective position (latitude, longitude)\n- As a demoer I want to start ship movement so the ships move on the map\n- As a fleet manager I want to select one ship from the table of ships and present a detail view of it with its containers loaded in the boat\n- As a demoer I want to start the fire to container or heat wave or container down simulation from the detailed ship view\n- As a demoer I want to see the message coming back from the streaming analytics about next best action from my simulation\n- As a manufacturer manager I want to enter container shipment order information like product reference, quantity,  pickup from address, earliest pickup date, shipment to address,  shipment by date, and required temperature in transit range so the shipping company can give me back an order confirmation ( including the orderID), expected pickup and delivery dates, the assigned voyage and ship name as the microservice will not have a dedicated UI, we are using the demonstration UI to define the forms to gather the data. So this user story is implemented in the kc-ui project, and in this microservice we need to offer the create and update operations and get by order ID\n- As a manufacturer manager I want to read the status of an order given its order id and receive a report with the full event history of related order, voyage ship and container events.\nThe order id is generated by the order create operation, and is immutable. An order is assigned to a voyage at the time it is created.\n\n### UI Development\n\nThis is a traditional Angular 7 app with the app.module.ts using `shared` and `features` modules. `Shared` is for UI generic widgets, while `features` are for supporting the UI specific components linked to the business logic.\nThere is no login page yet, but the home page displays a set of tiles to support the demonstration of the full shipment process as illustrated in the figure below:\n\n![kc-ui](images/kc-ui.png)\n\nFor the BFF code the server code is under the `server` folder and uses the standard patterns for expressjs middleware. The [readme file](./server/README.md) goes into the details on this implementation.\n\nThis project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.1. The user interface features are under the features folder. We are using a TDD approach as described in [this note.](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-caseportal-app/blob/master/docs/tdd.md) The tests run with `ng test`. We also encourage to read the [angular.io testing guide](https://angular.io/guide/testing)\n-->\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"fa735ad7dc70d5876954bab942ebfb7f","counter":410,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"User Interface","description":"In-depth description of the user interface microservice component of the Reefer Container Shipment solution reference implementation."},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: User Interface\ndescription: In-depth description of the user interface microservice component of the Reefer Container Shipment solution reference implementation.\n---\n\n<InlineNotification kind=\"warning\"><strong>TODO</strong> - UNDER CONSTRUCTION</InlineNotification>\n\n<PageDescription>\nThe user interface for our Reefer Container Shipment reference application is implemented as a single microservice using Node.js and Angular.js.\n</PageDescription>\n\n<AnchorLinks>\n  <AnchorLink>Overview</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Build</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Run</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Usage Details</AnchorLink>\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n## Overview\n\n**Description:** The goal of this component is to serve a user interface for customers to:\n\n- Log in\n- Create an order\n- List all orders\n- List all containers\n- Initiate shipping simulation\n\n![User Interface diagram](images/microservice-overview-user-interface.png)\n\n**Github repository:** [refarch-kc-ui](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-kc-ui)\n\n<InlineNotification kind=\"warning\"><strong>TODO</strong> Update topics, events, and patterns with the revised simulation design</InlineNotification>\n\n**Kafka topics consumed from:** None\n\n**Kafka topics produced to:** None\n\n**Events reacted to:** None\n\n**Events produced:** None\n\n**EDA Patterns implemented:** None\n\n## Build\n\nThis microservice is built using the [Appsody](https://appsody.dev/) development framework.
