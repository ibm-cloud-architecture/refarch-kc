Everything else is provided for you via OpenShift Operators or through existing GitHub repositories.\n- Additional self-paced learning can be done to integrate the deployed reference implementation with additional Kafka offerings, such as _IBM Event Streams_, _Red Hat AMQ Streams_, or _Confluent Platform_.\n\n## Step 1: Deploy the reference implementation\n\n- Go to [`https://learn.openshift.com/playgrounds/openshift45/`](https://learn.openshift.com/playgrounds/openshift45/) in a browser and click **Start Scenario**.\n\n- From a terminal that has access to your OpenShift cluster, download the [kcontainer-quickstart-ocp.sh](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-kc/tree/master/scripts/kcontainer-quickstart-ocp.sh) file:\n  ```\n  curl -o kcontainer-quickstart-ocp.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-kc/master/scripts/kcontainer-quickstart-ocp.sh\n  chmod +x kcontainer-quickstart-ocp.sh\n  ```\n   - The quickstart script is written for the most basic of OpenShift environments provided via [learn.openshift.com](https://learn.openshift.com/playgrounds/openshift45/).\n   - To override the default username and password used in the quickstart script for use in a different OpenShift environment, set environment variables with names of `OCP_ADMIN_USER` and `OCP_ADMIN_PASSWORD` to the appropriate values before executing the script.\n\n- Execute the quickstart deployment script with the following command:\n  ```\n  ./kcontainer-quickstart-ocp.sh\n  ```\n\n- Wait for the deployment to be active and ready when you are prompted with `Press any key to continue once an order has been submitted...`.\n\n- When accessing the user interface in the following steps, you should use the Route that exposes `kc-ui` microservice, which should be output in the terminal directly above the prompt.\n   - This will be referred to as `kc-ui-shipping.cluster.local` in the steps below.\n\n## Step 2: KContainer Manufacturer creating an order\n\nOrders are created via the manufacturer. For a reminder of the different personas, view the [Scenario Overview](/business-scenario/scenario-overview/).\n\n* Navigate to `http://kc-ui-shipping.cluster.local` (replacing the actual URL of the `kc-ui` microservice with the value output while running the quickstart script or available via `oc get route kc-ui`) to access the UI home page:\n\n![kc-home](kc-home.png)\n\nTo log in to the home page, you will need the following user email and password:\n\n- Email: eddie@email.com\n- Password: Eddie\n\nThe initial UI homepage shows an illustrated version of the business process. There are four tiles that can be used to simulate different parts of the outlined business process.\n\n* From the `Initiate Orders - Manufacturer` create a new 'fresh product' order to ship overseas. This simulates the activity that would usually be carried out by the manufacturer in our scenario.\n\n<InlineNotification kind=\"warning\">Do we need to have specific input here for containers to match/be found?</InlineNotification>\n\nTo represent different manufacturers, the first select box has been designed to support multiple scenarios in the future. For the purposes of this quickstart tutorial, select 'GoodManuf'.\n\n![](kc-manuf-select.png)\n\nOnce the manufacturer is selected, a list of existing orders will be displayed.\n\n![](kc-orders.png)\n\n* Select one order using the `Arrow` icon. This will allow you to view the order details:\n\n![](kc-order.png)\n\nAs illustrated in the CQRS diagram:\n\nThe creation of the order goes to the [Order Command microservice](/microservices/order-command/) which publishes an `OrderCreated` event to the `orders` topic and then consumes it to persist the data to its database. See the [source code here](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-kc-order-ms/blob/master/order-command-ms/src/main/java/ibm/gse/orderms/domain/service/ShippingOrderService.java#L39-L47).\n\n* We can create a consumer to take messages from the `orders` topic by running the following command from the same terminal the quickstart deployment script was run from:\n\n```oc rsh my-cluster-kafka-0 bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --from-beginning --timeout-ms 10000 --topic orders```\n\nAfter running this, you should be able to see the following order with the status of `pending` and the type of event being `OrderCreated`.\n\n```json\n{\"payload\":{\n    \"orderID\":\"1fcccdf2-e29d-4b30-8e52-8116dc2a01ff\",\n    \"productID\":\"Carrot\",\n    \"customerID\":\"GoodManuf\",\n    \"quantity\":10000,\n    \"pickupAddress\": \"...\",\n    \"expectedDeliveryDate\":\"2019-03-31T13:30Z\",\n    \"status\":\"pending\"},\n\"type\":\"OrderCreated\",\n\"version\":\"1\"}\n\n```\n\n## Step 2: K Container Shipment Manager looking at Orders\n\n* From the home page, click on the Shipment Manager - Shipping Inc tile:\n\n![](shipment-inc.png)\n\nThe home page lists the order that the shipment company received in the previous step.\n\n![](kc-shipment-home.png)\n\nThe status of events will be modified over time while the order is processed down stream by the voyage and container services. The following sequence diagram illustrates the flow:\n\n![](kc-order-seq-diag.png)\n\nLooking at the events in the voyage service\n```\nvoyages_1     |  emitting {\"timestamp\":1548788544290,\"type\":\"OrderAssigned\",\"version\":\"1\",\"payload\":{\"voyageID\":100,\"orderID\":\"1fcccdf2-e29d-4b30-8e52-8116dc2a01ff\"}}\n```\n\nor on the `orders` topic:\n\n```json\n{\"timestamp\":1548792921679,\n\"type\":\"OrderAssigned\",\"version\":\"1\",\n\"payload\":{\"voyageID\":100,\"orderID\":\"1fcccdf2-e29d-4b30-8e52-8116dc2a01ff\"}}\n\n```\n\n## Step3: View Fleet information\n\n<InlineNotification kind=\"warning\"><strong>UNDER CONSTRUCTION</strong></InlineNotification>\n\nNote: *The term 'Blue Water' referred to here means at sea (including ports and coastal waters).*\n\n* From the home page, select the `Simulate Blue Water` tile. Select one of the available fleet. As of now, only the North Pacific has fleet data:\n\n![](kc-fleet-select.png)\n\nThe fleet panel lists the ships, their location and status and a map:\n\n![](kc-fleet-home.png)\n\n* Select one ship with the edit button. You will see the ship detail view:\n\n![](kc-ship-detail.png)\n\nThis view contains information about the ship itself, it's position at sea and the load. There is also an option to simulate a number of disaster scenarios that could play out at sea, however this functionality is not yet implemented.\n\nThere are currently three pre-defined scenarios, which will be implemented in the future:\n\n* Fire affecting some containers\n* Reefer down\n* Ship experiencing conditions that cause reefers to exceed desired temperature.\n\nThis quickstart guide will be updated as the project evolves and new capability is added.
