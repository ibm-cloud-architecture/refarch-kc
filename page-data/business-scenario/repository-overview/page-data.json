Components\n\nThis solution supports a set of related repositories which includes those for the user interface, a set of microservices to implement the Event Sourcing and CQRS patterns and the source code to implement simulators and analytics content.\nIn each repository, we discuss the design and implementation approach, along with how to build and run them for development purposes.\n\nThe **Component** links below will take you to the individual component pages in the **Microservices Details** section of this manual, while the **GitHub Repository** links will take you directly to the source code for each individual component.\n\n**MVP Level** denotes minimal level of system capability to demostrate overall solution functionality.  *MVP Level 1* requires the least amount of
