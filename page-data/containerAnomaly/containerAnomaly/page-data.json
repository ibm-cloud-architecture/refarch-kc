The Spring Containers component expects **ContainerAnomaly** events.

Call the BPM process that will manage the assignment of a field engineer to have a look at and fix, if needed, the container at the destination port.\n2. Set the container into **MaintenanceNeeded** state which will prevent that container from getting any order assigned. This is important as containers does not always fail while carrying goods overseas in a ship but also while they are at the docks.\n3. Send an **OrderSpoilt** event to the orders topic, in case the container was allocated to an order and was carrying goods overseas, to notify any other Reefer Container Reference Application component that is interested on this event.\n\nOnce the BPM process has received the call from the Spring Container component, it will trigger a process whereby a field engineer will get assigned the task of checking and fixing the container, either at the dock where it is if it was not carrying goods overseas in a ship when the anomaly happened or once it gets to the destination port otherwise. Before the field engineer starts its work, the BPM process will interact to put the container into **InMaintenance** state. It will also interact to get the container off maintenance mode into **Empty** state, so that the container is again available for order allocation, once the container has been fixed.\n\nAs a result of the **OrderSpoilt** event sent into the orders topic, the Order Command component of our Reefer Container Reference Application that manages the orders will set the order, which the container with anomalies was allocated to and carrying goods for, to **Spoilt**.
