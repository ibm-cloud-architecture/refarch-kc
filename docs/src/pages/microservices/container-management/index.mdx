## Overview

<PageDescription>
This project is part of the container shipment implementation solution, and address the Reefer container management microservice implmentaiton. You can read more about the end to end solution [in this chapter.](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/refarch-kc/)
</PageDescription>

The source repository can be found at https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-kc-container-ms.

The goal of this Container management service is to support the reefer containers inventory management and to process all the events related to the container entity.

We are demonstrating in this project how to transform an event storming analysis to an event-driven microservice implementation and how to address ['reversibility'](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/garage/practices/run/reversibility-in-the-cloud) between the different platform. The service is packaged via dockerfile, and helm release is defined to deploy to kubernetes.

In distributed systems, it is common to find mechanisms for retrying calls to other, potentially external, services and fail gracefully if that service is unavailable for any reason.

You can read more about using non-blocking request reprocessing and dead letter queues (DLQ) to achieve decoupled, observable error-handling without disrupting real-time traffic in the context of the [Container Anomaly Use Case](#container-anomaly) of our Reefer Container Reference Application [here](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/refarch-kc/dlq/dlq)
