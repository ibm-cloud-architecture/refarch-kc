<PageDescription>
This microservice manages the container inventory. That is, this microservice will be in charge of keeping an inventory of all the containers registered in the system along with their status, size and location. When a new order is created and received, the container microservice will be in charge of assigning a container to this new shipping order based if a container is available that suits the order's quantity and source port. Otherwise, will emit a ContainerNotFound event for the interested parties in the overall Reefer Container Shipment solution.

The goal of this Container management service is to support the reefer containers inventory management and to process all the events related to the container entity.

We are demonstrating in this project how to transform an event storming analysis to an event-driven microservice implementation and how to address ['reversibility'](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/garage/practices/run/reversibility-in-the-cloud) between the different platform. The service is packaged via dockerfile, and helm release is defined to deploy to kubernetes.

In distributed systems, it is common to find mechanisms for retrying calls to other, potentially external, services and fail gracefully if that service is unavailable for any reason.

You can read more about using non-blocking request reprocessing and dead letter queues (DLQ) to achieve decoupled, observable error-handling without disrupting real-time traffic in the context of the [Container Anomaly Use Case](#container-anomaly) of our Reefer Container Reference Application [here](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/refarch-kc/dlq/dlq)
