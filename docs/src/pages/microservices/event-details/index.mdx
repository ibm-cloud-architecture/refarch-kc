## Order Command Event

Description: These events are produced as a result of user interaction through the [User Interface](/microservices/user-interface/). These events will command the creation, update or cancellation of a shipping order. In EDA space, a command is an action demanded or triggered by an actor. These events are of important relevance in the [Consume-transform-produce loop](/implementation/consume-transform-produce/) pattern.

Topic these events are produced to/consumed from:

- [Order Commands Topic](/microservices/topic-details/#order-commands-topic)

Components that produce these events:

- [Order Command](/microservices/order-command/)

Components that react to these events:

- [Order Command](/microservices/order-command/)

Patterns these events are relevant to:

- [Consume-transform-produce loop](/implementation/consume-transform-produce/)

These events will keep the original container anomaly message's data and a reason for this message to happen for further analysis by system administrators. These events are part of the [Container Anomaly](/implementation/container-anomaly/) and [Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)](/implementation/dead-letter-queue/) patterns.

Topic these events are produced to/consumed from:

- [Container Anomaly Dead Topic](/microservices/topic-details/#container-anomaly-dead-topic)

Components that produce these events:

- [Containers](/microservices/container-management/)

Components that react to these events: None

Patterns these events are relevant to:

- [Anomalous Container Tracking](/implementation/container-anomaly/)
- [Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)](/implementation/dead-letter-queue/)

## Container On Maintenance Event

Description: These events denote that a container has been set into maintenance mode as a result of a field engineer getting the container assigned to be repaired due to an anomaly being reported for such container. These events are a consequence of the [Container Anomaly](/implementation/container-anomaly/) pattern.

Topic these events are produced to/consumed from:

- [Containers Topic](/microservices/topic-details/#containers-topic)

Components that produce these events:

- [Containers](/microservices/container-management/)

Components that react to these events:

- [Containers](/microservices/container-management/)
- [Order Query](/microservices/order-query/)

Patterns these events are relevant to:

- [Anomalous Container Tracking](/implementation/container-anomaly/)
- Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)

## Container Off Maintenance Event

Description: These events denote that a container has been set out of maintenance mode as a result of a field engineer having repaired the container as a result of a container anomaly reported. These events are a consequence of the [Container Anomaly](/implementation/container-anomaly/) pattern.

## Voyage Assigned Event

Description: These events denote that a voyage has been found and assigned to a shipping order, and viceversa, as part of the [Saga pattern](/implementation/saga-patterns/) pattern for a long running transaction which is triggered as a result of a new shipping order being created. A voyage is a unique carriage of fresh goods by a ship from a source port to a destination port on a specific date.

Topic these events are produced to/consumed from:

- [Order Topic](/microservices/topic-details/#orders-topic)

Components that produce these events:

- [Voyages](/microservices/voyages/)

Components that react to these events:

- [Order Command](/microservices/order-command/)
- [Order Query](/microservices/order-query/)

Patterns these events are relevant to:

- [Saga pattern](/implementation/saga-patterns/)
- Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)

Data Schema: [Voyage Assigned Event Schema](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-kc/data_schemas/ibm/eda/kc/voyage/voyageAssignedEvent.avsc)

  },
  "timestamp": 1588010536409,
  "type": "VoyageAssigned",
  "version": "1"
}
```

## Voyage Not Found Event

Description: These events denote that a voyage for carrying the amount of fresh goods from the source port to the destination port on the specific date could not be found. As a result, the new shipping order will become rejected.

- [Order Topic](/microservices/topic-details/#orders-topic)

Components that produce these events:

- [Voyages](/microservices/voyages/)

Components that react to these events:
