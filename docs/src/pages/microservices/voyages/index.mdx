## Overview

<PageDescription>
This service keeps track of each scheduled, current or completed voyage of container carreer vessels, being loaded with containers at a source port, sailing to a destination port and having onboard containers unloaded there.
</PageDescription>

The source repository can be found at https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-kc-ms/tree/master/voyages-ms.

## User stories
This service keeps track of each of the container ships available for transporting containers. Each ship has a unique shipID. We limit the scope of a minimum viable product so the following user stories are implemented:

* [x] The information about each ship is kept in a json file for a fleet. Ships are uniquely identified by their name (as shipID).
* [x] The capacity of a ship is represented by a matrix, number of rows x number of columns to make it simpler. Therefore the total number of container is rows*columns.
* [x] Support GPS lat/log position reports, as ship position event, of the position of the ship a different point in time. This is modeled as csv file with one row of (lat,log) pair, a row representing a time stamp. (1h?)
* [ ] Generate ship event when leaving source port and when entering destination port, and when docked.
* [ ] Define query of what happen to a ship from a given time to retrace its past voyages.
