### Order Commands Topic

Topic name: **order-commands**

Description: The purpose for this topic is not other than to store the commands requested from users for creating, updating and cancelling orders for the [Order Command](#order-command) component to process these later by implementing the [Consume-transform-produce Loop](#consume-transform-produce-loop) pattern.

Components that produce events to this topic:

- [Order Command](#order-command)

Components that consume events from this topic:

- [Order Command](#order-command)

Messages that flow through:

- [Order Command Event](#order-command-event)

### Orders Topic

Topic name: **orders**

Description: This is probably the busiest topic in the overall Reefer Container Shipment reference application. This topic would be the place for any event that has to do with shipping orders. From having events from the [Order Command](#order-command) to notify other components of the solution that orders have been created, updated, cancelled and rejected to having events from other components to notify that an order has got a container allocated, a voyage assigned or event that a container has spoilt the fresh goods it is carrying due to an anomaly in the container.

Components that produce events to this topic:

- [Order Command](#order-command)
- [Order Query](#order-query)
- [Containers](#containers)
- [Voyages](#voyages)

Components that consume events from this topic:

- [Order Command](#order-command)
- [Containers](#containers)
- [Voyages](#voyages)

Messages that flow through:

- [Order Created Event](#order-created-event)
- [Order Updated Event](#order-updated-event)
- [Order Spoilt Event](#order-spoilt-event)
- [Order Reject Event](#order-reject-event)
- [Order Cancel Event](#order-cancel-event)
- [Container Allocated Event](#container-allocated-event)
- [Container Not Found Event](#container-not-found-event)
- [Voyage Assigned Event](#voyage-assigned-event)
- [Voyage Not Found Event](#voyage-not-found-event)

### Errors Topic

Topic name: **errors**

Description: Messages in this topic will denote errors while processing user commands by the [Order Command](#order-command) component.

Components that produce events to this topic:

- [Order Command](#order-command)

Components that consume events from this topic: None

Messages that flow through:

- [Error Event](#error-event)

### Containers Topic

Topic name: **containers**

Description: This is the second busiest topic of the overall Reefer Container Shipment reference application since it will be used for creating containers, receiving container anomalies, setting containers to maintenance, etc.

Components that produce events to this topic:

- [Containers](#containers)
- [Telemetry](#telemetry)

Components that consume events from this topic:

- [Containers](#containers)
- [Order Query](#order-query)

Messages that flow through:

- [Container Added Event](#container-added-event)
- [Container Assigned Event](#container-assigned-event)
- [Container Anomaly Event](#container-anomaly-event)
- [Container On Maintenance Event](#container-on-maintenance-event)
- [Container Off Maintenance Event](#container-off-maintenance-event)

### Container Anomaly Retry Topic

Topic name: **container-anomaly-retry**

Description: This topic will only contain [Container Anomaly Retry Events](#container-anomaly-retry-event) as part of the [Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)](#dead-letter-queue-(dlq)) pattern implementation.

Components that produce events to this topic:

- [Containers](#containers)

Components that consume events from this topic:

- [Containers](#containers)

Messages that flow through:

- [Container Anomaly Retry Event](#container-anomaly-retry-event)

### Container Anomaly Dead Topic

Topic name: **container-anomaly-dead**

Description: This topic will only contain [Container Anomaly Dead Events](#container-anomaly-dead-event) as part of the [Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)](#dead-letter-queue-(dlq)) pattern implementation.

Components that produce events to this topic:

- [Containers](#containers)

Components that consume events from this topic:

- [Containers](#containers)

Messages that flow through:

- [Container Anomaly Dead Event](#container-anomaly-dead-event)

### Reefer Telemetry Topic

Topic name: **reefer-telemetry**

Description: This topic will only hold [Container Telemetry Events](#container-telemetry-event) as part of the [Container Anomaly](#container-anomaly) and [Reactive Messaging](#reactive-messaging) patterns. These events are simply the sensor telemetries reported back from the containers.

Components that produce events to this topic:

- [Simulator](#simulator)

Components that consume events from this topic:

- [Telemetry](#telemetry)

Messages that flow through:

- [Container Telemetry Event](#container-telemetry-event)
