In this tutorial, you will:

- Deploy the reference implementation to a standalone OpenShift cluster.
- Create an order via the UI.
- Check on existing orders.
- View information about the Fleet.

Each of these business processes will be executed step-by-step using the demonstration APIs and some scripts.

### Pre-requisites

- **Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform** - this quickstart utilizes either the [OpenShift Playgrounds](https://learn.openshift.com/playgrounds/openshift45/) or the [IBM OpenLabs](https://developer.ibm.com/openlabs/openshift).
- ... and that's it!!! Everything else is provided for you via OpenShift Operators or through existing GitHub repositories.
- Additional self-paced learning can be done to integrate the deployed reference implementation with additional Kafka offerings, such as _IBM Event Streams_, _Red Hat AMQ Streams_, or _Confluent Platform_.
