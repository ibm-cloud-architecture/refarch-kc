### OpenShift Playgrounds

In this section, we are going to see how to deploy the KContainer Shipping Container Reference Implementation on the [OpenShift Playgrounds](https://learn.openshift.com/playgrounds/openshift45/) hosted environment.

1. Go to [`https://learn.openshift.com/playgrounds/openshift45/`](https://learn.openshift.com/playgrounds/openshift45/) in a browser and click **Start Scenario**.

1. From a terminal that has access to your OpenShift cluster, download the [kcontainer-quickstart-ocp.sh](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-kc/tree/master/scripts/quickstart/kcontainer-quickstart-ocp.sh) file:
  ```
  curl -o kcontainer-quickstart-ocp.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-kc/master/scripts/quickstart/kcontainer-quickstart-ocp.sh
  chmod +x kcontainer-quickstart-ocp.sh
  ```

   _(\*) To override the default username and password used in the quickstart script for use in a different OpenShift environment, set environment variables with names of_ `OCP_ADMIN_USER` _and_ `OCP_ADMIN_PASSWORD` _to the appropriate values before executing the script._

1. Execute the quickstart deployment script with the following command:
  ```
  ./kcontainer-quickstart-ocp.sh
  ```

1. Wait for the deployment to be active and ready when you are prompted with `Press any key to continue once an order has been submitted...`.

   _(\*) This will be referred to as_ `kc-ui-shipping.cluster.local` _in the step 2 of this quickstart._

1. You can also check all the resources created by the `kcontainer-quickstart-ocp.sh` script in the RedHat OpenShift console by clicking on the console tab and using the appropriate credentials displayed on the instructions section to log in.
