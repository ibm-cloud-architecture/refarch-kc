### IBM OpenLabs

In this section, we are going to see how to deploy the KContainer Shipping Container Reference Implementation on the [IBM OpenLabs](https://developer.ibm.com/openlabs/openshift) hosted environment.

1. Go to [IBM OpenLabs](https://developer.ibm.com/openlabs/openshift) in a browser and click on `Launch Lab` button for **Lab 6**.

1. You will be presented with a dialog asking you whether you have an **Opportunity Id** or not. If you don't have it or don't no, just select **No** and click on **Launch Lab**.

1. You should now see your IBM OpenLabs environment.

1. On the left hand side navigation menu, click on the **Quick Links and Common Commnads** section. Now, if you scroll down on the instructions shown on your screen, you should reach the **Commonly Used Command** section of these and in there you should see an `oc login ...` command to get your terminal associated to this IBM OpenLabs Lab 6 logged into the OpenShift cluster that you will be working with for this quickstart tutorial. Click on the `oc login...` command and you should see a `Login successful` message on the terminal.

1. In the terminal associated to your lab, download the [kcontainer-quickstart-ocp.sh](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-kc/tree/master/scripts/quickstart/kcontainer-quickstart-ocp.sh) file:

  ```
  curl -o kcontainer-quickstart-ocp.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-kc/master/scripts/quickstart/kcontainer-quickstart-ocp.sh
  chmod +x kcontainer-quickstart-ocp.sh
  ```

1. Execute the quickstart deployment script with the following command:

  ```
  ./kcontainer-quickstart-ocp.sh --skip-login
  ```
  **IMPORTANT:** do not forget the **- -skip-login** flag since we have already logged into the RedHat OpenShift cluster above.

1. Wait for the deployment to be active and ready when you are prompted with `Press any key to continue once an order has been submitted...`.
