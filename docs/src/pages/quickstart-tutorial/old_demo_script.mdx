* Select one ship with the edit button. You will see the ship detail view:

![](images/kc-ship-detail.png)

This view contains information about the ship itself, it's position at sea and the load. There is also an option to simulate a number of disaster scenarios that could play out at sea, however this functionality is not yet implemented.

There are currently three pre-defined scenarios, which will be implemented in the future:

* Fire affecting some containers
* Reefer down
* Ship experiencing conditions that cause reefers to exceed desired temperature.
